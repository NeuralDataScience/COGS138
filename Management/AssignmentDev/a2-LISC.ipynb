    "This assignment will demonstrate how to pull data from an API, how to work with the [LISC package](https://lisc-tools.github.io/lisc/), and test your knowledge of working with classes and numpy.\n",

    "## Installing LISC on datahub\n",
    "\n",
    "From the datahub ```Files``` browser, you'll see a dropdown menu titles ```New```. From there select ```Terminal```, and that will open a new terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in the Terminal, execute the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install lisc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "You need to **replace (meaning, delete) these lines of code with code that answers the questions** and meets the specified criteria. Make sure you remove the 'raise' line when you do this (or your notebook will raise an error, regardless of any other code, and thus fail the grading tests).\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Printing Variables\n",
    "You can (and should) print and check variables as you go. This allows you to check what values they hold, and fix things if anything unexpected happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Restarting the Kernel\n",
    "- If you run cells out of order, you can end up overwriting things in your namespace. \n",
    "- If things seem to go weird, a good first step is to restart the kernel, which you can do from the kernel menu above.\n",
    "- Even if everything seems to be working, it's a nice check to 'Restart & Run All', to make sure everything runs properly in order."

    "An interesting question is whether this is driven by true differences in how those regions are studied, or whether it's an issue of the fact that we are limited by the terminology being used when we get the counts using LISC. For example, neurophysiologists generally don't study the \"occiptal lobe\", rather they focus on subregions (V1, V2), or refer to the cortex specifically using the phase \"occipital cortex\" rather than \"occipital lobe\". One could try to get around this problem by explicitly including all of the subregions of the occipital lobe. Alternatively one could simply search for the more general \"occipital\", to encompass both \"occipital lobe\" and \"occipital cortex\", however this runs into the issue that the medical literature will also include research on the \"occipital bone\"."
