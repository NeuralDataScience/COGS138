# Overview

COGS 138 - Neural Data Science - is a class offered by the Cognitive Science Department of UC San Diego, taught by Professor Bradley Voytek and co-developed with Professor Ashley Juavinett. Here is an overview and map of the COGS 138 Organization, which hosts materials and assignments for the class.

## Syllabus

The most recent iteration of this class is the upcoming winter quarter 2022, the [**syllabus**](COGS138_Wi22.pdf) for which is in progress.

## Lectures

Slides and materials will be organized by week. Links to lecture slides and notebooks will be included here.

## Tutorials

We've begun to put together basic tutorials for core concepts [here](https://github.com/NeuralDataScience/Tutorials)

## Assignments

Assignments will (probably) be completed on [datahub.ucsd.edu](http://datahub.ucsd.edu).

## Readings

Suggested readings can be found on the [readings page](https://github.com/NeuralDataScience/Readings).

## Final Projects

A core component of the class is completing a final group project. You can see the past project from the Winter 2021 version of the class [here](https://github.com/NeuralDataScience/Projects/tree/main/Wi2021).

## A reminder about time:

These assignments are intermingled with your project proposal and final project (due finals week). This is an assignment-heavy course load to get you as much practice as possible. This will require good time management and planning on your part. Start planning ahead now to avoid late submissions and issues later in the quarter.
